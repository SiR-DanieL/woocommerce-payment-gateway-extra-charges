# WooCommerce Payment Gateway Extra Charges

WooCommerce Payment Gateway Extra Charges is a WordPress plugin.
This extension will add an extra field in each WooCommerce Payment Gateway that will allow you to add extra charges to your gateways. It's useful for COD payment gateway, in example, since WooCommerce does not allow this by default.
